# ftp_proxy
This WSGI script implements a http to ftp proxy for Apache2 (tested under Ubuntu 16.04).
Nexus Repository Manager from Sonatype is able to base raw proxies on http and https,
but not on ftp and this script shall help to circumvent this.

This is my first attempt on WSGI, Python programming and Apache2 configuration, please be gentle with your comments :-)

## Invocation

### First Try
Call
```bash
wget http://localhost/ftp_proxy?ftpurl=ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.7.tar.gz
```
in order to perform a ftp download from *ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.7.tar.gz*.

This needs a line
```
WSGIScriptAlias /ftp_proxy /var/www/html/ftp_proxy.py
```
e.g. in *conf-enabled/wsgi.conf*

### Get Rid of CGI Parameters in the URL
In order to be able to call
```
wget http://localhost/ftp/ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.7.tar.gz
```
we may rewrite the url. Put
```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^/ftp/(.*)$ /ftp_proxy?ftpurl=$1 [L,R,H=wsgi-script]
```
into *sites-enabled/000-default.conf*. We also need the *WSGIScriptAlias* from above.

## Limitiations

1. No handling of authentication for ftp.

## TODO
1. Test with Nexus Repository Manager.
2. ~~Use mod_rewrite of Apache2 to get rid of the CGI style parameter passing in the URL - I'm not sure, if Nexus Repository Manager is happy with this. Preferably, the download above should work with this URL:
*http://localhost/ftp/ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.7.tar.gz*~~
3. Test with escaped chars in the ftp URL.
